# Designing-Database-Amazon
This project aims to design Amazon e-commerce database from scratch using Oracle SQL. Firstly, requirement are collected and an ER Diagram is created (in a sequential order). The ER-diagram was mapped into relational schema, which was further normalized to 3-NF. Tables were created along with constraints in Oracle SQL. Then stored procedures (like place order, etc.) are added followed by adding triggers (like update product, seller rating, etc.). The stored procedures and triggers are done using PL/SQL. This project is a part of my Masters' course - Database Design at University of Texas at Dallas
